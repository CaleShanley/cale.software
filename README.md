## üßê About this Project

1. This Website is created using React and Gatsby. I've also learnt to use [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) during this project.

2. What I really enjoyed about this project was how much I learnt with all the new techniques i have used throughout the project. For example the Styled-Components, using svg images and importing them, using Grid / Flexbox for CSS and Gatsby / Graphql.

3. Something else I learnt to use was [Media Queries](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp). I made the problem of starting off on Desktop mode and having to redo all the CSS to make it responsive for smaller screens / iphones.

## ü§ñ Todo List

1. I wanted to get my Images fixed, some aren't responsive and i believe thats because of grid.

2. I also wanted to add a more in detail page about myself and possibly a page for my Resume/CV.

3. A slideshow as well with some extra Images.
